## The rules of the Simon game

The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.

1- At the beginning, one of the 4 keys randomly lights up.
2- The player has to press the same key.
3- Next, the Simon turns on a second one, again randomly.
4- The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory. After each correct pattern match, the level is incremented.
5- In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.
6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on and your level goes up!

## What is Jquery?
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
